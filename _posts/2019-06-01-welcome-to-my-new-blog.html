<p>
  I have to be honest now.. this is probably the billionth time I start a new
  personal blog or website. However, this is the first time in my entire life
  that I feel confident to start writing completely in <b>english</b>.
</p>

<h3>English? What is the big deal?</h3>

<p>
  I am from <em>Brazil</em> and my mother language is <em>Portuguese</em>. For
  many times I have tried to start learning english and, until 7 months ago, I
  couldn't read even a children's book. In November-2018, in the middle of my
  30s and with a huge support from my lovely wife, I came to
  <em>Sydney-Australia</em> as an exchange english student. I am far from being
  fluent, but now I think I am able at least to share a little bit of knowledge.
</p>

<h3>What should you expect to read here?</h3>

<p>First of all, a lot of grammar mistakes ðŸ˜¥.. but hope not forever ðŸ˜Œ.</p>

<p>
  I want to talk about computing and science in general. I had graduated in
  <em>computer science</em> and for several years I have been working mostly
  with <code>programming</code>, <code>digital images</code> and
  <code>computer graphics</code>, but I am completely keen on the idea to
  correlate <code>scientific and creative computing</code>. As any knowledge
  obsessed person, I am always learning and cannot promise that I won't explore
  other subjects ðŸ˜š.
